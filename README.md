This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Router Dom v6 involving nested routes. The bug occurs when nested routes are not properly configured, leading to incorrect rendering. The solution showcases how to correctly define and handle nested routes to prevent this issue. The `NestedRouteBug.jsx` file contains the buggy code and the `NestedRouteSolution.jsx` file demonstrates the corrected implementation.
