In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when nested routes are not properly defined or handled, leading to unexpected rendering or routing behavior.  For example, if you have a parent route `/dashboard` and a child route `/dashboard/settings`, and you try to access `/dashboard/settings` directly without proper nesting, it might not render correctly, potentially showing a 404 error or rendering the parent route instead.
